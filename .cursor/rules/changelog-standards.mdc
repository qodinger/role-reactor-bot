## 1. Changelog Structure and Format

**IMPORTANT:** These rules MUST be followed whenever creating or updating changelog entries. Always verify the current date before adding version dates.

- **File Location:** `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (always in the docs directory)
- **Format:** Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format
- **Versioning:** Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Date Format:** Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) for all version dates (year-month-day order to avoid ambiguity)
- **Date Verification:** **ALWAYS run `date +%Y-%m-%d` or check system date before adding any version date**
- **Header Structure:**

  ```markdown
  # Changelog

  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
  and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

  ## [Unreleased]

  ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
  ```

## 2. Content Categories

- **Added:** New features, commands, or functionality
- **Changed:** Changes to existing functionality
- **Deprecated:** Features marked for removal in future versions
- **Removed:** Features removed in this version
- **Fixed:** Bug fixes and improvements for **released features only**
- **Security:** Security-related changes
- **Performance:** Performance improvements and optimizations

### Important Categorization Rules

- **Fixed Section:** Only include fixes for features that have been released to users
- **Unreleased Features:** New features go in "Added" section, not "Fixed" section
- **Developer Commands:** Do not include internal developer tools in user-facing changelog
- **Breaking Changes:** Always document breaking changes prominently

## 3. Writing Guidelines

**CRITICAL:** When updating the changelog, you MUST:

1. Check the actual current date using `date +%Y-%m-%d` before adding any version date
2. Follow user-focused, non-technical language
3. Focus on what users can do, not technical implementation
4. Use the format and examples provided in this document

### User-Focused Descriptions

- **Focus on user impact, not technical implementation**
- **Use clear, non-technical language that humans can understand**
- **Describe what users can do, not how it's built**
- **Avoid technical jargon and implementation details**
- **Write meaningful, human-readable entries**

**Good Examples:**

- ✅ "Poll System: Create and manage native Discord polls with `/poll` command"
- ✅ "Command Timeouts: Fixed 'Unknown interaction' errors that occurred when commands took too long to respond"
- ✅ "Interactive Poll Creation: Easy-to-use forms for creating polls with custom duration and vote types"

**Bad Examples:**

- ❌ "Poll System: Complete native Discord poll system with interactive creation and management"
- ❌ "Command Interaction Timeouts: Added immediate deferral to prevent 'Unknown interaction' errors across all commands"
- ❌ "Poll Data Storage: MongoDB integration for storing poll data with automatic cleanup"
- ❌ "API Endpoint: Added `/api/stats` endpoint for bot statistics"
- ❌ "Database Migration: Successfully migrated XP data from files to MongoDB"
- ❌ "Fixed delay pattern in `handleUnban` function to match other handlers"

### Entry Format

- **Use bullet points with descriptive titles**
- **Keep entries concise but informative**
- **Group related changes together**
- **Use consistent tense (past tense for completed changes)**
- **Avoid repeating the feature name in the description when it's obvious**

**Format:**

```markdown
- Feature Name: Brief description of what users can do or experience
- Command Name: What the command does or how it was improved
- System Name: User-visible changes or improvements
```

**Good Format Examples:**

```markdown
- Voice Roles Command: New `/voice-roles` command to automatically manage users in voice channels based on roles
- Voice Roles Subcommands: `/voice-roles disconnect`, `/voice-roles mute`, `/voice-roles deafen`, `/voice-roles move`, and `/voice-roles list` subcommands for complete voice management
```

**Avoid Redundancy:**

```markdown
❌ Bad: Voice Roles Command: New voice control command for managing voice channels
✅ Good: Voice Roles Command: New `/voice-roles` command to automatically manage users in voice channels based on roles
```

## 4. Version Management

### Unreleased Section

- **Always maintain an [Unreleased] section at the top**
- **Add new changes to [Unreleased] during development**
- **Move [Unreleased] content to versioned section when releasing**

### Version Numbering

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **MINOR (X.Y.0):** New features, backward-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH (X.Y.Z):** Bug fixes, backward-compatible improvements

### Release Process

**MANDATORY STEPS - MUST BE FOLLOWED:**

1. **Development:** Add changes to [Unreleased] section
2. **Release:** Move [Unreleased] content to new version section
3. **Date Verification (CRITICAL):**
   - **STOP and run `date +%Y-%m-%d` or check system date**
   - **Use the verified current date for the version entry**
   - **Never guess, assume, or use a date without verification**
4. **Update:** Add release date and clear [Unreleased] section
5. **Commit:** Include changelog updates in release commit

**AI Instructions:** When updating the changelog, you MUST verify the current date using a system command before adding any version date. This is not optional.

### Release Date Accuracy

- **CRITICAL: Always Check Current Date:** Before adding a version date, **always verify the actual current date** using system date or reliable date source. Never assume or guess the date.
- **Date Verification Steps:**
  1. Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` (Unix/macOS) or check system date
  2. Use the verified current date for new version entries
  3. For existing versions, verify using git commit history
- **Use Git History:** Always verify release dates using `git log --grep="version"` or `git show <commit-hash> --format="%ad" --date=short`
- **Actual Commit Dates:** Use the date from the version bump commit, not arbitrary dates
- **Format:** Use YYYY-MM-DD format consistently (year-month-day order to avoid ambiguity)
- **Verification:** Double-check dates against actual git commit history and current system date before finalizing
- **Never Guess:** If unsure about a date, always check the actual current date or git history rather than guessing

## 5. Content Organization

### Grouping Related Changes

- **Group similar features together**
- **Order by importance (user-facing features first)**
- **Separate major features from minor improvements**

**Example Structure:**

```markdown
### Added

- Major Feature: Primary new functionality
- Command Group: Related commands or features
- Minor Feature: Smaller additions

### Fixed

- Critical Issues: High-impact bug fixes
- Performance: Speed and reliability improvements
- UI/UX: User interface improvements
```

### Prioritization

1. **User-facing features and commands**
2. **Bug fixes and improvements**
3. **Performance and reliability**
4. **Technical improvements (only if user-visible)**

## 6. Quality Standards

### Clarity and Readability

- **Use active voice when possible**
- **Be specific about what changed**
- **Avoid vague descriptions**
- **Include command names when relevant**

### Consistency

- **Use consistent terminology throughout**
- **Follow the same format for similar entries**
- **Maintain consistent capitalization**
- **Use consistent punctuation**

### Completeness

- **Include all significant changes**
- **Don't include trivial changes (typos, minor refactoring)**
- **Ensure all user-visible changes are documented**
- **Include breaking changes prominently**

### Context and Links

- **Documentation Links:** When relevant, include links to documentation or migration guides
- **Breaking Changes:** Always provide clear migration instructions or links to migration guides
- **Related Issues:** Optionally reference related GitHub issues or PRs when helpful for context
- **Examples:** Include brief usage examples for new commands or features when it adds clarity
- **Format:** Use markdown links: `[Link Text](https://example.com)`

**Example:**

```markdown
- Voice Roles Command: New `/voice-roles` command to automatically manage users in voice channels based on roles. See [documentation](link) for setup instructions
- Breaking Change: Removed `/old-command`. Use `/new-command` instead. See [migration guide](link) for details
```

### What NOT to Include

- **Developer Commands:** Internal tools like `/core-management`, `/health`, `/performance`, `/storage`
- **Technical Implementation:** Database migrations, code refactoring, internal architecture changes
- **Unreleased Feature Fixes:** Don't put "fixes" for features that haven't been released yet
- **Internal Security:** Developer-only security improvements that don't affect users
- **Code Quality:** Linting fixes, formatting changes, documentation updates
- **Minor Performance:** Small optimizations that users won't notice (only include significant improvements that users will experience)
- **Test Fixes:** Test-related fixes that don't affect user-visible functionality
- **CI/CD Changes:** Build pipeline, workflow, or deployment script changes (unless user-visible)
- **Function Names:** Avoid mentioning specific function names, class names, or code identifiers
- **Technical Jargon:** Avoid terms like "API endpoint", "MongoDB", "Repository", "Database migration", "refactoring", "architecture"

### Removed

- Old Feature Name: Brief explanation of why it was removed (if relevant)
```

**Note:** Don't explicitly link them unless the replacement is obvious. Let users understand the new feature on its own merits.

## 8. Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Updates

- **Update changelog with every significant change**
- **Review and refine entries before releases**

- **Ensure entries are clear to non-technical users**

### Review Process

- **Read entries from user perspective**
- **Ask: "Would a user care about this detail?"**
- **Simplify complex technical descriptions**
- **Focus on outcomes, not implementation**

### Version Control

- **Include changelog updates in feature commits**
- **Don't wait until release to update changelog**
- **Keep [Unreleased] section current during development**
- **Clean up [Unreleased] section when releasing**
