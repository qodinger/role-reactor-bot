globs: CHANGELOG.md
---

## 1. Changelog Structure and Format

- **File Location:** `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (always in the docs directory)
- **Format:** Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format
- **Versioning:** Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Date Format:** Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) for all version dates (year-month-day order to avoid ambiguity)
- **Header Structure:**

  ```markdown
  # Changelog

  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
  and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

  ## [Unreleased]

  ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
  ```

## 2. Content Categories

- **Added:** New features, commands, or functionality
- **Changed:** Changes to existing functionality
- **Deprecated:** Features marked for removal in future versions
- **Removed:** Features removed in this version
- **Fixed:** Bug fixes and improvements for **released features only**
- **Security:** Security-related changes
- **Performance:** Performance improvements and optimizations

### Important Categorization Rules

- **Fixed Section:** Only include fixes for features that have been released to users
- **Unreleased Features:** New features go in "Added" section, not "Fixed" section
- **Developer Commands:** Do not include internal developer tools in user-facing changelog
- **Breaking Changes:** Always document breaking changes prominently

## 3. Writing Guidelines

### User-Focused Descriptions

- **Focus on user impact, not technical implementation**
- **Use clear, non-technical language that humans can understand**
- **Describe what users can do, not how it's built**
- **Avoid technical jargon and implementation details**
- **Write meaningful, human-readable entries**

**Good Examples:**

- ✅ "Poll System: Create and manage native Discord polls with `/poll` command"
- ✅ "Command Timeouts: Fixed 'Unknown interaction' errors that occurred when commands took too long to respond"
- ✅ "Interactive Poll Creation: Easy-to-use forms for creating polls with custom duration and vote types"

**Bad Examples:**

- ❌ "Poll System: Complete native Discord poll system with interactive creation and management"
- ❌ "Command Interaction Timeouts: Added immediate deferral to prevent 'Unknown interaction' errors across all commands"
- ❌ "Poll Data Storage: MongoDB integration for storing poll data with automatic cleanup"

### Entry Format

- **Use bullet points with descriptive titles**
- **Keep entries concise but informative**
- **Group related changes together**
- **Use consistent tense (past tense for completed changes)**

**Format:**

```markdown
- Feature Name: Brief description of what users can do or experience
- Command Name: What the command does or how it was improved
- System Name: User-visible changes or improvements
```

## 4. Version Management

### Unreleased Section

- **Always maintain an [Unreleased] section at the top**
- **Add new changes to [Unreleased] during development**
- **Move [Unreleased] content to versioned section when releasing**

### Version Numbering

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **MINOR (X.Y.0):** New features, backward-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH (X.Y.Z):** Bug fixes, backward-compatible improvements

### Release Process

1. **Development:** Add changes to [Unreleased] section
2. **Release:** Move [Unreleased] content to new version section
3. **Update:** Add release date and clear [Unreleased] section
4. **Commit:** Include changelog updates in release commit

### Release Date Accuracy

- **Use Git History:** Always verify release dates using `git log --grep="version"` or `git show <commit-hash> --format="%ad" --date=short`
- **Actual Commit Dates:** Use the date from the version bump commit, not arbitrary dates
- **Format:** Use YYYY-MM-DD format consistently
- **Verification:** Double-check dates against actual git commit history before finalizing

## 5. Content Organization

### Grouping Related Changes

- **Group similar features together**
- **Order by importance (user-facing features first)**
- **Separate major features from minor improvements**

**Example Structure:**

```markdown
### Added

- Major Feature: Primary new functionality
- Command Group: Related commands or features
- Minor Feature: Smaller additions

### Fixed

- Critical Issues: High-impact bug fixes
- Performance: Speed and reliability improvements
- UI/UX: User interface improvements
```

### Prioritization

1. **User-facing features and commands**
2. **Bug fixes and improvements**
3. **Performance and reliability**
4. **Technical improvements (only if user-visible)**

## 6. Quality Standards

### Clarity and Readability

- **Use active voice when possible**
- **Be specific about what changed**
- **Avoid vague descriptions**
- **Include command names when relevant**

### Consistency

- **Use consistent terminology throughout**
- **Follow the same format for similar entries**
- **Maintain consistent capitalization**
- **Use consistent punctuation**

### Completeness

- **Include all significant changes**
- **Don't include trivial changes (typos, minor refactoring)**
- **Ensure all user-visible changes are documented**
- **Include breaking changes prominently**

### What NOT to Include

- **Developer Commands:** Internal tools like `/core-management`, `/health`, `/performance`, `/storage`
- **Technical Implementation:** Database migrations, code refactoring, internal architecture changes
- **Unreleased Feature Fixes:** Don't put "fixes" for features that haven't been released yet
- **Internal Security:** Developer-only security improvements that don't affect users
- **Code Quality:** Linting fixes, formatting changes, documentation updates

## 8. Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Updates

- **Update changelog with every significant change**
- **Review and refine entries before releases**
- **Remove technical details that don't benefit users**
- **Ensure entries are clear to non-technical users**

### Review Process

- **Read entries from user perspective**
- **Ask: "Would a user care about this detail?"**
- **Simplify complex technical descriptions**
- **Focus on outcomes, not implementation**

### Version Control

- **Include changelog updates in feature commits**
- **Don't wait until release to update changelog**
- **Keep [Unreleased] section current during development**
- **Clean up [Unreleased] section when releasing**

## 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Don't include implementation details**
- **Don't use technical jargon**
- **Don't be too verbose**
- **Don't skip user-visible changes**
- **Don't include trivial changes**
- **Don't use present tense for completed changes**
- **Don't mix technical and user-focused descriptions**
- **Don't forget to update [Unreleased] section**
- **Don't include developer commands in user-facing changelog**
- **Don't put "fixes" for unreleased features in Fixed section**
- **Don't use arbitrary dates - always verify with git history**
- **Don't include database migrations or internal architecture changes**
- **Don't mention "renamed" commands if the old command was never released**

## 10. Integration with Development

### During Development

- **Add entries as features are developed**
- **Update entries when features change**
- **Review entries during code review**
- **Refine entries before merging**

### Before Release

- **Review all [Unreleased] entries**
- **Simplify and clarify descriptions**
- **Remove technical implementation details**
- **Focus on user benefits and outcomes**
- **Ensure consistency in tone and format**
