- **Detailed Results**: Click on vote counts to see who voted for what
- **Immediate End**: Can end polls immediately if needed
- **Poll Management**: List, delete, and view results of polls

## Native Poll System

### How Native Polls Work

1. Users click on their desired option(s) in the poll
2. Discord handles all voting logic and UI updates automatically
3. Real-time results are shown with animated progress bars
4. Users can change their votes by clicking different options
5. Click on vote counts to see detailed participant lists

### Native Poll Features

- **Automatic UI**: Discord handles all visual elements and interactions
- **Real-time Updates**: Results update instantly as users vote
- **Animated Progress**: Smooth progress bars show vote percentages
- **Detailed Results**: Click vote counts to see who voted for what
- **No Bot Dependencies**: Polls work even if the bot is offline

## Poll Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Poll is created with specified options and settings
2. **Active**: Users can vote on the poll
3. **Expiration**: Poll automatically expires after the specified duration
4. **Cleanup**: Expired polls are cleaned up automatically

## Storage

Polls are stored using the existing storage system:

- **File Storage**: Stored in `data/polls.json`
- **Database Storage**: Stored in database if configured
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired polls are cleaned up every hour

## Permissions

### Required Bot Permissions

- `SendMessages`: Send poll messages
- `EmbedLinks`: Create rich embeds
- `AddReactions`: Add emoji reactions
- `ReadMessageHistory`: Read message history

### User Permissions

- **Create Polls**: Any user can create polls
- **Vote**: Any user can vote (subject to role limits)
- **Delete Polls**: Only poll creator or users with `ManageMessages` permission
- **View Results**: Any user can view poll results

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Options**: Validates poll options and emojis
- **Permission Errors**: Checks user permissions before allowing actions
- **Rate Limiting**: Handles Discord API rate limits gracefully
- **Storage Errors**: Graceful fallback if storage operations fail

## Examples

### Simple Poll

```
/poll create question:"What should we have for lunch?" options:"Pizza|Burger|Salad|Sushi"
```

### Advanced Poll with Role Limits

```
/poll create question:"Which feature should we prioritize?" options:"Feature A|Feature B|Feature C" emojis:"ðŸš€|ðŸ’¡|ðŸ”§" duration:48 role-limits:"VIP:3|Moderator:2|Member:1" allow-multiple:true
```

### Anonymous Poll

```
/poll create question:"Rate our service" options:"Excellent|Good|Average|Poor" anonymous:true duration:72
```

## Integration

The poll system integrates with:

- **Existing Reaction System**: Uses the same reaction handlers as role reactions
- **Storage System**: Uses the existing storage manager
- **Permission System**: Uses the existing permission validation
- **Logging System**: Uses the existing logger for debugging

## Maintenance
