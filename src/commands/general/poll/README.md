## Native Poll System

### How Native Polls Work

1. Users click on their desired option(s) in the poll
2. Discord handles all voting logic and UI updates automatically
3. Real-time results are shown with animated progress bars
4. Users can change their votes by clicking different options
5. Click on vote counts to see detailed participant lists

### Native Poll Features

- **Automatic UI**: Discord handles all visual elements and interactions
- **Real-time Updates**: Results update instantly as users vote
- **Animated Progress**: Smooth progress bars show vote percentages
- **Detailed Results**: Click vote counts to see who voted for what
- **No Bot Dependencies**: Polls work even if the bot is offline

## Poll Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Poll is created with specified options and settings
2. **Active**: Users can vote on the poll
3. **Expiration**: Poll automatically expires after the specified duration
4. **Cleanup**: Expired polls are cleaned up automatically

## Storage

Polls are stored using the existing storage system with MongoDB integration:

- **Primary Storage**: MongoDB database (if configured)
- **Fallback Storage**: File-based storage in `data/polls.json`
- **Automatic Sync**: Data syncs between file and database storage
- **Message ID Tracking**: Uses Discord message ID as poll identifier
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired polls are cleaned up after 24 hours

## Permissions

### Required Bot Permissions

- `SendMessages`: Send poll messages
- `EmbedLinks`: Create rich embeds
- `AddReactions`: Add emoji reactions

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Options**: Validates poll options and emojis
- **Permission Errors**: Checks user permissions before allowing actions
- **Rate Limiting**: Handles Discord API rate limits gracefully
- **Storage Errors**: Graceful fallback if storage operations fail
