## 🔧 Setting Up Gaming Roles

### Pre-Setup Checklist

Before creating your gaming role messages:

1. **Create all roles first** in Server Settings > Roles
2. **Set role colors** to match your server theme
3. **Position bot role** above all gaming roles
4. **Choose appropriate channel** (#roles, #gaming, #welcome)

### Role Naming Tips

- **Keep names short** - easier to read in member lists
- **Use clear descriptions** - members should understand immediately
- **Be consistent** - same naming pattern across all roles
- **Avoid special characters** - can cause issues with commands

### Best Practices

- **Start with basics** - platforms and main games first
- **Add gradually** - don't overwhelm with too many options
- **Get feedback** - ask your community what roles they want
- **Regular cleanup** - remove unused roles periodically

## 🎯 Making It Interactive

### Announcements

Pin a message explaining your role system:

```
📌 **Welcome to our Gaming Community!**

🎮 **Get your gaming roles** in #roles
🎯 **Find teammates** using @role mentions  
🏆 **Join events** by watching role-specific announcements
🎙️ **Voice chat** with people who share your interests

Questions? Ask in #help!
```

### Channel Organization

Create channels that complement your roles:
- `#pc-gaming` - For PC Gamer role
- `#console-chat` - For Console Gamer role  
- `#competitive-lfg` - For competitive players
- `#game-nights` - For event coordination
