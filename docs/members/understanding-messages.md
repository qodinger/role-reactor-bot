# Understanding Role Messages

Learn how to read, interpret, and interact with role messages to get the most out of your Discord server experience.

## What Are Role Messages?

Role messages are special interactive messages created by Role Reactor Bot that allow you to assign roles to yourself by clicking on emoji reactions. These messages serve as self-service role selection interfaces that give you control over your server experience.

## Anatomy of a Role Message

### Basic Components

**Every role message contains:**

1. **📋 Title** - Describes the category or purpose
2. **📝 Description** - Instructions and additional information  
3. **🎯 Role List** - Emojis paired with role names
4. **⚡ Bot Reactions** - Clickable emojis below the message

### Example Role Message Breakdown
