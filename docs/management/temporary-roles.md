## üéØ Best Practices

### Planning Duration

**Consider these factors:**
- **Event length** - How long will the activity last?
- **Buffer time** - Add extra time for delays
- **Time zones** - Account for different member locations
- **Cleanup time** - Time to wrap up and transition

**Duration recommendations:**
- **Live events** - Actual duration + 1 hour buffer
- **Daily activities** - 1 day
- **Weekly events** - 1 week  
- **Trials** - 1-2 weeks
- **Achievements** - 1 day to 1 week

### Documentation

**Always include reasons:**
- **Track why** roles were assigned
- **Easy reference** for staff
- **Member understanding** of their access
- **Audit trail** for server management

**Good reason examples:**
- `"Movie night - The Avengers - 7PM EST"`
- `"Contest winner - Art competition Week 15"`
- `"VIP trial - New member welcome program"`
- `"Beta tester - Bot feature testing Phase 2"`

### Communication

**Let members know:**
- **What the role gives them** access to
- **How long it lasts**
- **What happens when it expires**
- **How to get help** if needed

**Example announcement:**
```
üéâ @member has been given @EventAccess for tonight's movie night!

‚úÖ Access to #movie-chat and voice channels
‚è∞ Role expires in 4 hours
üé¨ Tonight's movie: The Matrix (8PM EST)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage

### Bulk Assignments

For multiple people:
```
/assign-temp-role user:@member1 role:@EventAccess duration:2h reason:"Gaming tournament batch 1"
/assign-temp-role user:@member2 role:@EventAccess duration:2h reason:"Gaming tournament batch 1"  
/assign-temp-role user:@member3 role:@EventAccess duration:2h reason:"Gaming tournament batch 1"
```

### Cascading Roles

Different durations for different access levels:
```
# Basic access for all participants
/assign-temp-role user:@participant role:@EventAccess duration:3h reason:"Workshop participant"

# Extended access for helpers
/assign-temp-role user:@helper role:@EventHelper duration:4h reason:"Workshop helper - extra cleanup time"

# Full day access for organizers
/assign-temp-role user:@organizer role:@EventOrganizer duration:1d reason:"Workshop organizer - setup and follow-up"
```

### Role Stacking

Multiple temporary roles for the same person:
```
# Event access
/assign-temp-role user:@vip role:@EventAccess duration:4h reason:"Premium event access"

# VIP perks
/assign-temp-role user:@vip role:@VIPPerks duration:4h reason:"VIP member perks for event"

# Early access
/assign-temp-role user:@vip role:@EarlyAccess duration:5h reason:"30min early access + event time"
```

## üö® Important Notes

### Role Hierarchy

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Remember:** The bot can only assign roles that are **below** its own role in your server hierarchy!
{% endhint %}

### Persistence

- **Temporary roles survive bot restarts** - stored in database
- **Expiration continues** even if bot goes offline temporarily  
- **Manual removal** is always possible with `/remove-temp-role`

### Permissions

- **Same permissions required** as regular role assignment
- **Role must exist** in your server before assignment
- **Bot needs "Manage Roles"** permission

### Limitations

- **Maximum duration:** 4 weeks
- **Minimum duration:** 1 minute
- **No automatic renewal** - must reassign if needed
- **No bulk removal command** - remove individually

## üìä Monitoring Usage

### Regular Reviews

**Weekly checks:**
- Review `/list-temp-roles` for upcoming expirations
- Clean up any roles that should be removed early
- Plan upcoming events and role needs

**Monthly analysis:**
- Which temporary roles are used most?
- Are durations appropriate for activities?
- Do members understand the system?
- Any needed adjustments to processes?

### Member Feedback

**Ask members:**
- Are role durations appropriate?
- Is the purpose of temporary roles clear?
- Would they like notifications before expiration?
- Any suggestions for improvement?
