# Using Emojis and Roles

Learn how to effectively combine emojis with roles to create an intuitive and visually appealing role selection system for your Discord server.

## Understanding Emoji-Role Pairs

Each role in your role message is paired with an emoji that members click to get that role. The emoji serves as both a visual identifier and the interaction method.

### Emoji Format Requirements

```

## Best Practices for Emoji Selection

### 1. Choose Meaningful Emojis

Select emojis that clearly represent the role's purpose:

✅ **Good Examples:**
- 🎮 for Gaming roles
- 🎵 for Music roles
- 📚 for Study/Educational roles
- 🎨 for Creative roles
- 🏆 for Achievement roles

❌ **Avoid:**
- Random emojis that don't relate to the role
- Similar-looking emojis for different roles
- Too many complex custom emojis

### 2. Consider Color Coordination

Match emoji colors with role colors when possible:

```
🔴 Red Team     (Red role color)
🔵 Blue Team    (Blue role color)
🟢 Green Team   (Green role color)
🟡 Yellow Team  (Yellow role color)
```

### 3. Maintain Consistency

Use consistent emoji styles throughout your server:

**Theme: Gaming Server**
```
🎮 PC Gaming
🎯 Competitive
🎲 Casual Gaming
🏆 Tournament Player
```

**Theme: Study Server**
```
📚 Mathematics
🧪 Science
📝 Literature
🌍 Geography
```

## Troubleshooting Emoji Issues

### Common Problems

**Emoji Not Displaying:**

**Reactions Not Working:**
- Bot needs "Add Reactions" permission
- Emoji might be from another server (external emoji permission needed)
- Check if emoji was deleted or renamed

**Emoji Appears as Text:**
- Custom emoji format might be incorrect
- Emoji ID might be wrong
- Server might not have access to the emoji

### Solutions

1. **Test emojis first:** Send a test message with the emoji
2. **Use emoji picker:** Right-click and copy emoji to get correct format
