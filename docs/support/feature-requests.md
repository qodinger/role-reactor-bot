## How to Submit Feature Requests

### Before Submitting a Request

**Research First:**
```
✅ Check existing documentation for the feature
✅ Search previous feature requests to avoid duplicates
✅ Test current bot functionality thoroughly
✅ Consider if the feature fits the bot's purpose
✅ Think about how it would benefit the community
```

**Consider Alternatives:**
```
Ask yourself:
• Can this be achieved with existing features?
• Would a different approach solve the same problem?
• Is this a common need or very specific use case?
• How would this feature impact other users?
```

### What Makes a Good Feature Request

```
✅ Good Example:
"As a server admin, I find it difficult to track which roles are most popular among members. I would like analytics or statistics about role usage to help me understand member interests and optimize our role selection."

```

**Detailed Feature Description:**
```
Include:
• What the feature should do
• How users would interact with it
• What commands or interface it would use
• How it would integrate with existing features
• Examples of how it would be used
```

**Use Case Examples:**
```
Provide scenarios like:
• "A gaming server could use this to see which games are trending"
• "Educational servers could track study group participation"
• "Community servers could identify underused role categories"
```

### Example Complete Request

```markdown
## Feature Name
Role Assignment Scheduling

## Problem Statement
Server admins often want to give members temporary access to special roles for events, but have to manually remove them afterwards. This leads to forgotten temporary roles and cluttered member role lists.

## Proposed Solution
Add the ability to assign roles with automatic expiration dates. When creating a role message or manually assigning roles, admins could set a duration after which the role is automatically removed.

## Use Cases
- Event-specific roles that should expire after the event
- Trial periods for premium roles
- Seasonal roles that should auto-remove after holidays
- Study group roles that expire at semester end
- Contest participant roles with automatic cleanup

## User Stories
- As a server admin, I want to assign event roles that automatically expire so I don't have to manually clean them up later
- As a member, I want to know when my temporary roles will expire so I can plan accordingly
- As a moderator, I want to see which roles are temporary when helping members

## Implementation Ideas
- Add duration parameter to role creation: `/role create duration:7d`
- Show expiration time in role confirmations: "Added Gaming Event (expires in 6 days)"
- Daily cleanup job to remove expired roles
- Notification system to warn before expiration
- Admin dashboard to view all scheduled role removals

## Benefits
- Reduces admin workload for temporary roles
- Keeps member role lists clean and relevant
- Prevents forgotten event roles from accumulating
- Enables more creative use of temporary access
- Improves overall server organization

## Alternative Solutions
- Manual reminder systems (current workaround)
- Separate bot dedicated to temporary roles
- Calendar-based role management

## Priority Level
High - This would enable new types of community engagement and significantly reduce admin maintenance
