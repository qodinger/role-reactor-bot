# Reporting Bugs

Learn how to identify, document, and report bugs effectively to help improve Role Reactor Bot for everyone.

## How to Identify Bugs

### What Qualifies as a Bug

**Definite Bugs:**
```
✅ Bot giving wrong roles or no roles when clicked
✅ Error messages that shouldn't appear
✅ Commands not working as documented
✅ Role messages not updating when they should
✅ Bot crashes or becomes unresponsive
✅ Security vulnerabilities or unauthorized access
```

**Not Bugs (Configuration Issues):**
```
❌ Bot can't assign roles due to hierarchy/permissions
❌ Discord client display issues
❌ User not understanding how features work
❌ Server-specific permission restrictions
❌ Internet connectivity problems
```

**Gray Area (May Be Bugs):**
```
⚠️ Unexpected behavior that's not clearly wrong
⚠️ Performance issues or unusual slowness
⚠️ Features working differently than expected
⚠️ Inconsistent behavior across platforms
⚠️ Integration issues with other bots
```

### Bug vs. Feature Request

**Bug Indicators:**
```
Something is broken:
• Feature worked before, now doesn't
• Error messages appear unexpectedly  
• Bot behavior contradicts documentation
• Security or data integrity issues
• Crashes or system instability
```

**Feature Request Indicators:**
```
Something is missing:
• "I wish the bot could..."
• "It would be better if..."
• "Other bots have this feature..."
• "Can you add support for..."
• "This would improve the experience..."
```

## Before Reporting a Bug

### Basic Troubleshooting

**Try These Steps First:**
```
1. ⚡ Restart Discord (close completely and reopen)
2. ⏳ Wait 5-10 minutes and try again
3. 🔄 Try on a different device or browser
4. 👥 Ask if others experience the same issue
5. 📖 Check documentation for correct usage
6. 🔍 Search existing bug reports
```

**Verify It's Actually a Bug:**
```
Confirmation Checklist:
□ Issue persists after restart
□ Other users can reproduce the problem
□ Behavior contradicts documented functionality
□ Error is consistent and repeatable
□ Not caused by server configuration
```

Role assignment confirmation messages not appearing

## Bug Description
When clicking emoji reactions to get roles, the roles are successfully assigned (visible in member list), but the bot doesn't send the usual confirmation message in DM or channel.

After clicking a role reaction, bot should send a confirmation message like "✅ Added Gaming to your roles!" either via DM or in the channel.

Role gets assigned successfully, but no confirmation message appears anywhere. Makes it unclear if the role assignment worked.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to #role-selection channel
2. Click any emoji reaction on a role message
3. Check member list - role is added correctly
4. Wait for confirmation message - none appears
5. Try different roles - same issue

## Error Messages
No error messages appear. The process seems to work but without feedback.

## Environment
- Platform: Desktop App
- Operating System: Windows 11
- Discord Version: Stable 167623 (64-bit)
- Browser: N/A

## Additional Information
